We can play multiple patterns at the same time using the stack function

d1 $ stack [
s "bd ~ bd bd",
sometimesBy 0.3 (# speed (-0.5)) $ s "~ cp",
s "hh*16" # release 0.1
]

Now we can change the single patterns and the whole in the same block of code

d1
$ every 6 (scramble 8)
$ every 4 ((degradeBy 0.5) . (ply 2))
$ stack [
sometimesBy 0.1 (linger (1/16)) $ s "bd ~ bd bd",
sometimesBy 0.3 (# speed (-0.5)) $ s "~ cp",
s "hh*16" # release 0.1
]
